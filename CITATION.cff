abstract: >-
  PRISM is a Bayesian framework for quantitative hypothesis evaluation 
  that integrates multiple statistical methods to convert heterogeneous 
  scientific evidence into calibrated probability estimates. Key features 
  include reference class priors with uncertainty quantification, 
  hierarchical correlation correction, REML meta-analysis with 
  Hartung-Knapp adjustment, P-curve publication bias detection, 
  optimizer's curse correction, and Claude AI integration for 
  automated evidence extraction.
